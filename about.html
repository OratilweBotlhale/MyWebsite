            <h1>Hi, I'm Oratilwe but since we’re friends now, call me Aura!</h1>
         <br>
            <p>I’m literally a 20-year-old, trying to make it by in life while doing what I Iove. I was born and raised in Johannesburg South,
            South Africa but currently based in the Vaal.</h3>
            <p>
            <p>I'm a creative at heart with a love for fashion, makeup, and digital storytelling.
            For me, getting dressed, applying makeup, or planning a shoot isn’t just about looking good — it’s about expressing who I am and what I stand for.
            Content creation allows me to turn everyday moments into visual art, connect with people who share my energy, and inspire confidence through creativity.</p>
            <br>
           <p>At the same time, I’m deeply passionate about technology. As a 3rd-year IT student, I spend just as much time behind the screen as I do in front of the camera. 
            I believe in breaking stereotypes — 
            proving that you can code and contour, debug and design, all in the same day.
            I’m building a path where beauty and tech collide, and I want to show other young women that they don’t have to choose between their passions. They can own all of them.

          <p>
            My journey through beauty, fashion, and tech has never just been about trends or tools —
            it's always been about purpose. I believe God gives us gifts not just to shine, but to serve. 
            Every pose I strike, every project I code, every post I create — it all comes from a place of gratitude and grace.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I'm not perfect, but I'm purposeful. I move with faith, create with love, and trust God's timing in everything I do.
            This website, my work, and my story are living proof that you can walk in both style and spirit.
